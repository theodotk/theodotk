# Hello

My name is Bogdan Reznychenko, I am a Data Scientist/MLE in [Probayes](https://www.probayes.com/en/) and I have a PhD in Quantum Physics and some relevant experience in Quantum computing/algorithms.

I am currently looking for a job in the US or in Canada, in Quantum Software Dev or (Quantum or Classical) Machine Learning. And yeah, I don't have H1B.

### This repository

This repository is meant to show my progress in coding, life and the rest of 42. The projects here are:

- [foobar](https://github.com/theodotk/foobar): my solutions to the medium and hard problems of the
[Google foobar challenge](https://towardsdatascience.com/google-foobar-challenge-level-1-3487bb252780).
Basically, these are LeetCode style problems.
- [quantum_control](https://github.com/theodotk/quantum_control): a personal project,
where I use reinforcement learning to put and hold a qubit in a state I want it to be. I also had some fun making `ipywidgets` interface to show the result.
- In [quantum_computing](https://github.com/theodotk/quantum_computing) I experimented with `qiskit` and quantum machine learning by solving a simple IBM quantum challenge problem.
- pennylane repo was created to fix an issue with [this pull request](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2686). 
- divinum-officium repo is a long work in progress, where I add Ukrainian translation of the Latin Mass into my repo,
but I don't want to merge it until a relatively complete version is ready.

### CV

If you stumbled upon me on github, please see my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdan-reznychenko-phd/).
But in short, I have worked in a client-facing role on different projects on:

#### ML:

+ Time series forecasting with various underlying models (neural networks, Markov and Bayesian models, standard tools like gradient boosting, linear regression etc).
The most interesting results so far: the week I joined a project that has been going on for half a year, I suggested a different approach, and it raised the R2 score from about 0.01 to 0.5.
+ Causal inference: establishing an effect of a particular factor (way of contact a client, prices of products) on a desired outcome. In all the projects I identified and implemented the most appropriate models from research papers into shipping products.
+ Reinforcement learning: drone flying in a simulation. So far the agent is doing what I want it to do.

#### Quantum:

+ I also led a non-ML international interdisciplinary research project on quantum-assisted computation.
I developed architecture and a compiler for a quantum co-processor and evaluated potential computational benefits of the device.
+ In my PhD research:
  - I developed theoretical description of quantum measurement back-action and used it to control qubit state (in theory).
  - Collaborated with different experimental teams in description of experiments with qubits (QDs and transmons), including characterization.
  - Simulated experiments in Python and Matlab.

### Publications

You can also check out my [publications at Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.ua/citations?user=Pzrxt2YAAAAJ&hl=uk).
They are mostly in Physics though.
