# Hello

My name is Bogdan Reznychenko, I am a Quantum Software Engineer at [Photonic Inc](https://photonic.com/) based in Greater Vancouver area in BC, Canada. 

### This repository

This repository is meant to show my progress in coding, life and the rest of 42. The projects here are:

- [foobar](https://github.com/theodotk/foobar): my solutions to the medium and hard problems of the
[Google foobar challenge](https://towardsdatascience.com/google-foobar-challenge-level-1-3487bb252780).
Basically, these are LeetCode style problems.
- [quantum_control](https://github.com/theodotk/quantum_control): a personal project,
where I use reinforcement learning to put and keep a qubit in a state I want it to be. I also had some fun making `ipywidgets` interface to show the result.
- In [quantum_computing](https://github.com/theodotk/quantum_computing) I experimented with `qiskit` and quantum machine learning by solving a simple IBM quantum challenge problem.
- pennylane fork was created to fix an issue by merging [this pull request](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2686). You can look at it to see my work style (lots of commits for a simple problem, but I write docs and unit tests mostly without reminders).
- divinum-officium is a slow work in progress. The original repo is a multilingual translation of Roman Catholic Mass and Office, and I forked it to add my translation into Ukrainian (that were originally in LaTeX and for a non-Roman Western rite, so some adapting is needed...).

I also have [a GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/theodotk), where I participate in [another Divine Office project](https://gregorian-booklets.gitlab.io/vespers/), but the repo isn't public.

# CV

You have probably been there, but if not, go see my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdan-reznychenko-phd/).
But in short, I have worked in a client-facing role on different projects on:

## ML @ [Probayes](https://www.probayes.com/en/):

+ Time series forecasting with various underlying models (neural networks, Bayesian and Hidden Markov models, more standard tools like gradient boosting, linear regression etc).
The most interesting results so far: the week I joined a project that has been going on for half a year, I suggested a different approach, and it raised the R2 score from about 0.01 to 0.5.
+ Causal inference: establishing an effect of a particular factor (way of contact a client, prices of products) on a desired outcome. In all the projects I identified and implemented the most appropriate models from research papers into shipping products.
+ Reinforcement learning: drone flying in a simulation. So far the agent is doing what I want it to do. Also there is [quantum_control](https://github.com/theodotk/quantum_control) personal project.

## Quantum:

+ Currently I work as a Quantum Software developer at Photonic, where I own a tool for various simulations of physics a quantum system used by the company as a quantum computer building block.
+ Also, I developed a bunch of algorithms for simplifying work with wide and deep quantum circuits for the company.
+ On my previous job I led a CS part of an international interdisciplinary research project on quantum-assisted computation.
I developed architecture and a compiler for a quantum co-processor and evaluated potential computational benefits of the device.
+ In my PhD research:
  - I developed theoretical description of quantum measurement back-action and used it to control qubit state (in theory).
  - Collaborated with different experimental teams in description of experiments with qubits (QDs and transmons), including characterization.
  - Simulated experiments in Python and Matlab.

## Publications

You can also check out my [publications at Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.ua/citations?user=Pzrxt2YAAAAJ&hl=uk).
They are mostly in Physics, plus one on the interface between CS and Quantum Physics.
